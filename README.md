# SQL Injection PoC

This is a proof of concept for a basic SQL Injection attack and its mitigation using prepared statements.

## Files
- `vulnerable.php`: The PHP script with SQL Injection vulnerability.
- `secure.php`: The PHP script with SQL injection mitigation using prepared statements.

## How to Run
1. Set up a local server (e.g., XAMPP or WAMP).
2. Create a MySQL database `test_db` and add the `users` table with sample data.
3. Run the PHP files and test the SQL Injection.
